# ZMK Config for the Kinesis Mechanical Keypad LP

This repository contains the keymap files for the Kinesis Mechanical Keypad LP. Power users who prefer not to customize their device with Kinesis Clique (https://clique.kinesis-ergo.com/) or ZMK Studio (https://zmk.studio/) can use a graphical keymap editor (example: https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) or edit their keymap files directly on GitHub.

Kinesis does not officially support installing custom firmware on this device and no documentation, support or troubleshooting is offered. Proceed at your own risk. If you were to brick your keyboard with custom firmware that would invalidate your warranty.
